title: RunEpic | Bootstrapping the pipeline
file_version: 1.1.3
app_version: 1.18.21
---

The `RunEpic` function is provides the entrypoint for executing the pipeline. It parses command line options and executes the appropriate commands. These options are defined in the `ðŸ“„ src/ex/option_parser.hpp` and are based on the [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts) library (see [Command Line Options](command-line-options.obfbc4o9.sw.md)). The default command executes the imaging pipeline, and can execute multiple pipelines on separate GPUs by setting the `--ngpus`options to the desired number. Users can alternatively specify the `--printendpoints` command to display the observing frequencies broadcasted on each F-Engine endpoint.

The pipelines are initialized by the `EPIC`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/raft_kernels/epic_executor.hpp:125:2:2:`class EPIC : public EPICKernels&lt;_nthGPU - 1&gt; {`"/> class and the number of pipelines are set by its template parameter. This class recursively initializes another `EPIC`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/raft_kernels/epic_executor.hpp:125:2:2:`class EPIC : public EPICKernels&lt;_nthGPU - 1&gt; {`"/> object until the numer of desired pipelines is reached, and are added to a map.

### ðŸ“„ src/raft_kernels/epic_executor.hpp
```c++
124    template <unsigned int _nthGPU>
125    class EPIC : public EPICKernels<_nthGPU - 1> {
126     protected:
127      raft::map* m_map;
128      EPIC<_nthGPU - 1> m_next_epic;
```

<br/>

The `EPIC`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/raft_kernels/epic_executor.hpp:125:2:2:`class EPIC : public EPICKernels&lt;_nthGPU - 1&gt; {`"/>class inherits the kernels and pipeline initialization functionality from the `EPICKernels`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/raft_kernels/epic_executor.hpp:35:2:2:`class EPICKernels {`"/> class, which creates one pipeline at a time. Each member kernel in this class typicallly has a getter function which accepts a `cxxopts::Options`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/ex/option_parser.hpp:33:0:2:`cxxopts::Options GetEpicOptions() {`"/> object and returns an initialized kernel. These getter functions are defined in the `ðŸ“„ src/raft_kernels/kernel_types.hpp` file and are used in the member initializer list. After the kernels are initialized, they are bound to separate CPU cores in the `BindKernels2Cpu`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/raft_kernels/epic_executor.hpp:53:3:3:`  void BindKernels2Cpu(const KernelTypeDefs::opt_t&amp; p_options) {`"/> using `RftManip`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/ex/helper_traits.hpp:107:2:2:`using RftManip = raft::manip&lt;RftAffinityGrp&lt;AffGrpID&gt;, RftDeviceCpu&lt;CPUID&gt;&gt;;`"/> template. It binbs the kernel based on its two template parameters: `CPUID`, which specifies the CPU the kernel must be bound to and `AffGrpID`, which specifies the kernels affinity. Here the kernels in each pipeline are assigned consecutive core numbers with a gap of 2 between each pipeline. The kernels are linked together appropriately and are added to the raft map in the `InitMap`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/raft_kernels/epic_executor.hpp:73:3:3:`  void InitMap(const KernelTypeDefs::opt_t&amp; p_options) {`"/> function. Finally, the raft map is executed with all the pipelines.

Executing a two pipeline map

### ðŸ“„ src/raft_kernels/epic_executor.hpp
```c++
180        auto epic = EPIC<2>(options, &m);
```

<br/>

> _gotcha_: Do not forget to set number of kernels in the `m_nkernels`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/raft_kernels/epic_executor.hpp:39:9:9:`  static constexpr unsigned int m_nkernels{9};`"/> member. Incorrect values may cause multiple kernels to bind to the same core, which may lead to performance issues and undefined behaviour.
